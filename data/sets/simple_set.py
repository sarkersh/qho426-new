"""Activity 1: Simple Set
We can create a set in python using the function set().  For example, if we wish to create a set
representing web browsers then we can do this as follows:

web_browsers = set()

We can create and initialise our set with some elements by providing these between the curly brackets:

web_browsers = {"Chrome", "Firefox", "Edge"}"""

def observed():
    observations = {"Flying Car", "Sky Scraper", "Laser", "Dome"}
    return observations
def run():
    print(observed())

run()
