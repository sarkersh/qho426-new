Activity 1: Logical Operator
we can implement decisions with multiple conditions using logical (and/or/not) operators.
he logical operators work by evaluating expressions from the left to the right.
In the case of the "and" operator the expressions on both sides of the operator must evaluate to True.
In the case of the "or" operator an expression on other side of the operator must evaluate to True.
In the case of the "not" operator only one of the expressions must evaluate to True.
