Data Structures by complexity:
- primitive data types (are only built-in)
- complex data types

Data Structures by source:
- built-in
- user-defined (can only by complex)



Data Structures in Python at a glance:
- primitive data types
	int
	str
	boolean
	float
- complex data types
	list		ordered		changeable	allow duplicates
	tuple		ordered		unchangeable	allow duplicates
	set		    unordered	changeable	no duplicates
	dictionary	unordered/	changeable	no duplicates
			ordered (3.7)
	user-defined data types

Python does not have arrays as built-in data type (can add as a library)
Lists however can be used as arrays


Arrays vs Lists

Arrays were first
Array are slightly more memory-efficient

Arrays are fixed in size - lists are dynamic
Arrays can only store data of the same type - lists can store different data types
Hence lists can be used as arrays - but not the other way round
